# Anticaptcha Python Example
Code that illustrates usage of anticaptcha (anticaptchaofficial) in python with Selenium and chrome webdriver.

Repo just to help people with not having to figure it out, just copy and have fun.

If you are trying to webscrap and have to bypass captchas, this is the way I found.
